# Rustsam

This is a reimplementation of the Software Automatic Mouth, a speech
synthesizer originally built for the Commodore 64.

The implementation was based on an earlier reverse engineering attempt called
SamJs. In its current state Rustsam is a bug-for-bug port of this reference.
Future work will focus on fixing these bugs and restructuring the package to a
more elegant architecture.

This port was started as part of an effort to leverage SAM as a compositional
tool for the AY-3-8910/YM2812 and Konami SCC+ audio chips on the MSX platform.
